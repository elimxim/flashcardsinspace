        <p>We're over the moon to have you join us! You've just taken your first step into a larger world of learning. Prepare for launch, because your journey to mastering new knowledge is about to begin.</p>

        <p>Don't worry, we promise our flashcards are easier to handle than a spaceship's control panel. (And way less likely to accidentally eject you into space.)</p>

        <p>If you have any questions or just want to talk about aliens, feel free to reach out to our support team.</p>

        <p>Happy studying, and may the knowledge be with you!</p>

        <p>Cheers,<br>
