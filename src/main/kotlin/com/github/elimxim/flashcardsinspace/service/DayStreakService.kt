    /**
     * Calculates day-streak progress between two chronodays within a flashcard set timeline.
     *
     * The scan walks backwards from `fromInclusive` down to (but excluding) `toExclusive` and counts
     * consecutive COMPLETED days. Once counting has started, OFF (day-off/vacation) days are allowed:
     * they do not increase the count and do not break the streak. Before the first COMPLETED day is seen:
     *  - IN_PROGRESS days are ignored (skipped)
     *  - NOT_STARTED is ignored only when it is exactly the `fromInclusive` day
     *  - any other status (including OFF) stops the scan and results in a reset
     *
     * Returns:
     *  - Progress: at least one COMPLETED day was found; `count` equals newly
     *    counted COMPLETED days, and `lastDay` is the last COMPLETED Chronoday encountered
     *  - Reset: no COMPLETED day was found before the scan stopped; the caller should reset the streak (to 0)
     *    and typically set the last day to the current tail chronoday
     *  - NoChange: nothing to do (e.g., `fromInclusive` is INITIAL or the range is empty/invalid)
     *
     * Preconditions/assumptions:
     *  - `chronodays` includes both boundary days (matched by id) and belongs to a single set
     *  - `chronodays` are in chronological order so that index(fromInclusive) >= index(toExclusive)
     *  - Throws CorruptedChronoStateException if a boundary day cannot be found
     *
     * Time complexity: O(k) where k is the number of days between the two boundaries.
     *
     * @param fromInclusive the most recent chronoday to start scanning from (included)
     * @param toExclusive the chronoday to stop before (excluded)
     * @param chronodays the full timeline of chronodays for the set
     * @return [DayStreakScanResult] describing whether the streak progressed, reset, or did not change
